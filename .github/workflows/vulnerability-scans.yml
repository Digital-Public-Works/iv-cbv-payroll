# GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs vulnerability scans on the application's Docker image
# to ensure images built are secure before they are deployed.
#
# NOTE: Each job builds the image independently (jobs can't share artifacts easily).
#       However, all jobs use Docker Buildx registry cache to share layers, so builds after
#       the first are very fast (~2-3 min vs ~10 min).
